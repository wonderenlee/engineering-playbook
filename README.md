# [Project Name]

<!-- These badges are "Industry Gold Standard" for a healthy repository 
Note:
The Industry "Big Three" Explained

    Build Status (Reliability): This is non-negotiable. It proves the code actually compiles and passes the pytest suite you mentioned in your CONTRIBUTING.md. If this is red, the repo is considered "broken."

    Codecov/Coverage (Quality): In your guide, you set a target of 80% coverage. This badge holds the team accountable. It prevents "dark code" (untested logic) from creeping into the production main branch.

    Code Style/Black (Consistency): In Data Science and AI, we often collaborate across different teams. Using the "Black" badge signals to everyone: "Don't worry about formatting; we use a standardized, opinionated style."

Depending on the project, you might see these as well:

    License Badge: Critical for Open Source (usually MIT or Apache 2.0).

    Security (Snyk/Dependabot): Shows that your Python dependencies don't have known vulnerabilities.

    PyPI Version: If you are building a library for others to pip install. -->
