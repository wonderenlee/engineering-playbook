## Branching Strategy

To maintain consistency and quality throughout the development process, follow the branching strategy outlined below:

- **Base Branch (`develop`)**:

   - The `develop` branch serves as the default branch for active development.
   - All feature, experimental, and bugfix branches are created from the `develop` branch.

- **Feature Branches**:

   - Use `feature/<name>` to add new features or enhancements to the project.
   - Examples: 
       - `feature/add-logging` 
       - `feature/api-integration`

       **Workflow for Feature Branches:**
       1. **Create a Feature Branch** from `develop` branch: 
           ```bash
           git checkout develop
           git pull origin develop
           git checkout -b feature/add-logging
           ```
       2. Apply changes to add new feature/enhacement.
       3. **Push Changes**: 
           ```bash
           git add .
           git commit -m "feat(api): implement new API integration"
           git push origin feature/api-integration
           ```
       4. **Submit a Pull Request** for merging back into `develop`.

- **Experimental Branches**:
   - Use `experiment/<name>` for exploratory or temporary work that may not immediately integrate into active development.
   - Examples:
       - `experiment/improve-performance`
       - `experiment/additional-eda`

   - **Workflow for Experimental Branches**:
       1. An experimental branch can transition to a `feature/<name>` branch upon validation by the contributor or team. **Create an Experimental Branch** from `develop` branch: 
           ```bash
           git checkout develop
           git pull origin develop
           git checkout -b experiment/improve-performance
           ```
       2. Apply changes necessary for the experiment.
       3. **Push Changes**: 
           ```bash
           git add .
           git commit -m "experiment: enhance performance with new algorithm"
           git push origin feature/improve-performance
           ``` 
       4. **Submit a Pull Request**: 
           - If the experiment is validated:
Open a Pull Request to merge directly into the `develop` branch for immediate deployment.
           - If the experiment is not validated:
The branch can be discarded without submitting a Pull Request or merging.

- **Bugfix Branches**:
   - Use `bugfix/<name>` to fix small, non-urgent coding issues.
   - Examples:
       - `bugfix/fix-regression-error`
       - `bugfix/fix-off-by-one`

   - **Workflow for Bugfix Branches**:
       1. **Create a Bugfix Branch** from `develop`:
           ```bash
           git checkout develop
           git pull origin develop
           git checkout -b bugfix/fix-regression-error
           ```
       2. Apply changes to fix the bug.
       3. **Push Changes**: 
           ```bash
           git add .
           git commit -m "fix(regression): resolve regression error in data fetch"
           git push origin bugfix/fix-regression-error
           ```
       4. **Submit a Pull Request** for merging back into `develop`.

- **Hotfix Branches**:
   - Use `hotfix/<name>` for urgent  issues in production and require immediate application to the `main` branch. 
   - Examples:
       - `hotfix/fix-crash-bug`
       - `hotfix/db-connection-fail`
   - **Workflow for Bugfix Branches**:
       1. **Create a Hotfix Branch** from `main`: 
           ```bash
           git checkout main
           git pull origin main
           git checkout -b hotfix/db-connection-fail
           ```
       2. Apply changes to fix the issue. 
       3. **Push Changes**: 
           ```bash
           git add .
           git commit -m "fix(db): resolve connection pool timeout"
           git push origin hotfix/db-connection-fail
           ``` 
       4.  **Submit a Pull Request** for merging back into both:
           - `main` for immediate production patching.
           - `develop` for syncing the fix with the current development branch.

<!-- TODO - Review with team -->
- **Merging**:
   -  Always submit branches via Pull Requests (PRs):
       - `feature/<name>` and `bugfix/<name>` branches merge into the `develop`branch.
       - `hotfix/<name>` branches merge into both branches, `main` (for production) and `develop`.
   -  **Squash-and-Merge**: Use squash-and-merge when merging PRs to maintain a clean and readable commit history.  Squash-and-merge combines all commits from a branch into a single commit, making debugging and reviewing commit histories easier.

## Maintaining Documentation 

Keeping documentation up-to-date is critical to ensure a smooth and collaborative development process. This section outlines the steps to maintain and synchronize key project resources like **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)**, **[README.md](./README.md)
)**, and **Confluence pages**. All contributors share responsibility for maintaining documentation as part of the contribution process.

### **1. Centralizing Updates in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)** 

The **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)** file is the **source of truth** for all contributor-facing workflows, processes, and coding standards. When introducing new workflows, guidelines, or process changes: 

1. **Make Updates in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) First**: 
  - Locate relevant sections of the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
file that need updating (e.g., branching strategy, pull request guidelines, or testing standards). 
  - Add detailed instructions with examples to ensure clarity for contributors. 

   - **Examples of Changes**: 
     - Updating a branching strategy:
       ```markdown
       ### Updated Branching Strategy (2023):
       Bugfix branches should now branch off the `develop` branch instead of `main`. 
       ```
     - Adding new pre-submission requirements for a Pull Request:
       ```markdown
       Ensure all strings externalized for localization pass validation using `localization-validator`.
       ```

2. **Submit a Pull Request for Review**: 
  - After making updates, open a **Pull Request** to modify [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). 
  - Assign team reviewers and ensure consensus on the changes to ensure accuracy and alignment. 

### **2. Summarizing Key Updates in [README.md](./README.md)** 

Once updates to [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) are merged, **summarize key process changes in [README.md](./README.md)** for high-level visibility to all users (including non-developers). 

1. **Simplify the Content**:
  - Extract key points from [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and update applicable sections of the   [README.md](./README.md). 
  - Only include summaries or high-level overviews, with links back to [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)  for deeper detail.

   - **Examples**: 
     - Updating a workflow summary in   [README.md](./README.md):
       ```markdown
       ## Branching Strategy 

       - **Bugfix Branches**: Used for fixing small, non-urgent coding issues. Branch off from `develop`. 
         Detailed workflow: See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). 
       ```

2. **Open a Pull Request for Review**: 
  - Submit a Pull Request (PR) for updating the   [README.md](./README.md). Ensure the PR description highlights high-level changes so that reviewers understand what has been simplified or summarized.

### **3. Updating Confluence Documentation** 

Confluence pages serve as a centralized resource for **non-technical users, managers, and cross-functional teams**. After updating [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
and   [README.md](./README.md), synchronize those updates in Confluence. 

1. **Identify Relevant Changes**: 
  - Review recent updates in GitHub [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
or   [README.md](./README.md)).
  - Determine which updates are relevant for the Confluence audience (e.g., high-level summaries, workflow overviews, or key decisions). 

2. **Maintain Alignment with GitHub**: 
  - Summarize the updated processes in Confluence **using plain language** for non-technical audiences. 
  - Provide links back to the authoritative GitHub resources for detailed explanations:
    ```plaintext
    For technical details on branching workflows, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
    ```

3. **Maintain Version Control**: 
  - Update the "Last Updated" timestamp in Confluence to reflect the latest changes. 
  - Example:
    ```plaintext
    **Last Updated**: October 2023 
    Recent changes:
    - Updated branching workflows for bugfix and hotfix branches.
    - Added PR checklist requirements for localization validation.
    ```

4. **Notify the Team**: 
  - Post an announcement in Slack, Teams, or email to inform stakeholders of the changes. Highlight what is new and where to find the updated documentation.

### **4. Workflow for Harmonizing Updates** 

Use this workflow to keep documentation synchronized across all resources: 

```plaintext
1. Update -> [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
(source of truth for workflows, coding standards, and contributor information)
      |
      V
2. Summarize ->  [README.md](./README.md) (extract simplified, high-level summaries for general visibility)
      |
      V
3. Communicate -> Confluence (non-technical summaries for project managers, stakeholders, or team members outside GitHub)
```

### 5. **Best Practices for Document Updates**
To ensure documentation remains consistent and accurate:

- **Make Documentation Part of Every Contribution**:
 - Every Pull Request (PR) introducing new features, workflows, or fixes must include relevant documentation updates in either the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
,  [README.md](./README.md), or both.

- **Test Updates for Clarity**:
 - When updating [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
, include examples, commands, or workflows to make the steps actionable and easy to follow.
 - Use concise and precise language in  [README.md](./README.md) for broader audiences.

- **Review Documentation as Part of Code Reviews**:
 - PR reviewers should validate that documentation is updated wherever changes impact contributors or workflows.

- **Coordinate with Maintainers**:
 - Notify maintainers or documentation owners when significant changes impact the repository's documentation ecosystem (e.g., large workflow updates or new tool integrations).

- **Update Workflow Example**
 - Scenario: Updating Branching Workflow
   1. Update in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
(Source of Truth):
       ```markdown
       ### Bugfix Branch Workflow (2023 Update):
       - Bugfix branches now branch off `develop` instead of `main`. 
       - Updated Workflow:
         ```bash
         git checkout develop
         git pull origin develop
         git checkout -b bugfix/fix-connection-issue
         ```
   2. Summarize in  [README.md](./README.md):
       ```markdown
       ## Branching Strategy 
       - **Bugfix Branches**: Use `bugfix/<name>` for correcting non-urgent issues. 
       - Branch off from `develop` branch. 
       - For detailed workflow, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). 
       ```
   3. Confluence Update:
       ```plaintext
       ### Updated Bugfix Branch Workflow (October 2023)
       - Bugfix branches should now branch off `develop` instead of `main`. 
       - For detailed Git commands and examples, refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
       ```
   4. Communicate via Slack:
       - Post in the team's Slack channel:
         ```plaintext
         🚨 Branch Workflow Update 🚨 
         Team, we've updated the branching strategy for bugfix branches. 
         - Bugfix branches must now originate from `develop`. 
         - See the full workflow update here: [GitHub CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).  
         ```

### 6. Syncing Documentation
Make it a habit to follow this update protocol:

- All workflow/auth guideline changes start in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Simplify and summarize into  [README.md](./README.md) for a general audience.
- Share further summaries tailored for stakeholders in Confluence via non-technical language and direct GitHub links when needed.

By following these steps, we ensure tightly synchronized, consistent, and accessible documentation across platforms.
