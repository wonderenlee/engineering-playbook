## 🚦 Operational Workflow (Branching Strategy)

We utilize a structured branching model to isolate development work from production-ready code.

- Develop Branch: The integration hub. All new work flows here first.

- Feature Branches: New enhancements and AI/ML model development.

- Experimental Branches: Sandbox for exploratory data science work. Validated experiments are converted to features.

- Bugfix Branches: Resolution of non-urgent technical debt or errors.

- Hotfix Branches: URGENT production fixes. These bypass the standard queue to patch the main branch immediately.

_Governance Note: All code changes require a Pull Request (PR) and must be Squashed and Merged to maintain a clean project history for auditing._

## ✅ Quality Assurance Standards

Before code is accepted into the project, it must meet the following organizational benchmarks:

1. Peer Review: Every change requires approval from at least 2 qualified reviewers.

2. Automated Testing: Targeted code coverage is 80%. All pytest suites must pass.

3. Code Styling: Strict adherence to PEP-8, enforced by Black and Flake8.

4. Documentation: Inline comments and updates to high-level documentation are mandatory for every feature.

## 👥 Roles and Responsibilities

### Project Maintainers

Primary points of contact for architectural decisions and blocker resolution.

- [Name 1] (Backend Specialist): Lead for API and Data Pipeline issues.

- [Name 2] (DevOps/Team Lead): Lead for CI/CD, Branching, and Release Management.

- [Name 3] (Frontend Specialist): Lead for UI/UX and Visualization.

### Stakeholder Engagement

For managers and stakeholders outside the daily dev cycle:

- Reporting: GitHub Issues and Jira tickets are linked to provide clear traceability.

- Visibility: Significant workflow changes are announced in the #general Slack channel.

## 🔄 Documentation Synchronization Process

To avoid "Stale Documentation," we follow a strict update hierarchy:

1. Technical Change → Update CONTRIBUTING.md (Source of Truth).

2. Process Change → Update README.md (Summary).

3. Governance Change → Update this Confluence Page (Management View).

## ❓ Support & Help

If you encounter a roadblock:

1. Consult the CONTRIBUTING.md for technical FAQs.

2. Post in `#dev-support` (Slack) for real-time troubleshooting.

3. Contact the Maintainers listed above for project-level escalations.
