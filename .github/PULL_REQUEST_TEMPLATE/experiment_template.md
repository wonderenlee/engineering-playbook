## Results 

<!-- Briefly summarize the results of the experiment.
Example:
   - Tested K-means on three datasets with normalized features:
      | Dataset   | Silhouette Score |
      |-----------|------------------|
      | Dataset A | 0.65             |
      | Dataset B | 0.72             |
      | Dataset C | 0.68             |
   - Tracked resource usage and found that normalization increased computation time by 15%.
